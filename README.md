# Multi State Automata

## Summary
This is an implementation of a multi-state automata for the LILYGO ESP32 T-Display. The code is written in the Arduino IDE, so other Arduino-compatible devices may be able to run the code with some basic modifications. Many thanks to [Erik Fransson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvZI6Xc0J1Y&t=76s) for inspiration. I also go into more detail about the decision decisions behind the project here: TODO!!

## Materials
[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
LILYGO ESP32 T-Display
USB-C cable

## Quick Start Guide
1. Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) on your computer of choice
2. Install the "TFT_eSPI" library by Bodmer and the "Adafruit GFX" library by Adafruit in the Arduiino IDE using the library manager (Tools/Manage Libraries).
3. Install the relevant [ESP32 Drivers](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO-T-Display)
4. Download the project file at (Arduino/CES_Module_1.ino)
5. Open the project file
6. Plug the ESP32 into your computer
7. Press the upload button on the top left of the screen to upload your code to the ESP32.

8. That's it! The code should now be running on the ESP32 and keep simulating the automata as long as it can draw power from your computer.
